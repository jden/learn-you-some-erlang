hello! here i'm going to be going through some code samples and stuff from the
book Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!, which is a charming book with an
adorable squid-thing on the cover. The squid has thick eyebrows and a neckbeard.
The book is thicker than I thought it would be! It has over 500 pages.

Welp, here goes.
